# 📊 Income Prediction ML App

Welcome to the **Income Prediction Machine Learning Web App**! This application predicts whether a person's annual income exceeds $50k based on various input features. Built using **Streamlit** and a powerful machine learning model, it provides a user-friendly interface for accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and interactive form for data input.
- **Machine Learning Powered:** Trained on the **Adult Income Dataset** for high accuracy.
- **Efficient Model:** Uses the **CatBoost** algorithm for efficient and precise predictions.
- **Cloud-Ready:** Deployed on **Azure Cloud** with continuous integration for automatic updates.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for building and training the model.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for creating the interactive app.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **CatBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting algorithm used for predictions.
- **Azure Cloud**: Cloud platform for app deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous deployment pipeline for automatic updates.
